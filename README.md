# language-detect

This repository defines a set of rules and statistics for identifying Norwegian written language variants. Some of these language variants are very similar to the base variant, so special measures must be taken to identify the correct variant. Plain naïve Bayes with N-grams is not enough to get a high quality detection on short text fragments.

In particular; Høgnorsk is very similar to Nynorsk, and Riksmål is very similar to Bokmål. The variant Moderat Bokmål is in between Bokmål and Riksmål, and is even harder to identify correctly.

## Overview

The language files are split into three sets for each language variant; one N-gram set, one affix set, and one term set.

The N-gram statistics is a bit unusual by using a space replacement character. This set will catch some of the affixes, but not the long ones, and the statistics will be somewhat diffuse compared with the affix rules and the keywords. The N-grams might catch infix rules that are otherwise lost.

As some affixes can be quite long in Norwegian, and also stacked, like "bilistene" (the motorists, definite plural), separate statistics is built for the affix rules to avoid very long N-grams.

The keywords are a list of known words where the written language forms diverge. This is quite interesting as some of the words are quite good markers, especially for older texts. The keywords have rules to control inflection

## Usage

Each statistics gives a count of the number of occurences after capitalized words are removed from the text, litteral quotes are removed, and the terms that don't pass spellchecking are removed. Spellcheckers for Bokmål and Nynorsk are pretty forgiving, so most of the language variants should pass without any problem.

Capitalized words are removed on an assumption that it is highly likely that such words are names, and thus are very noisy as they often comes from other cultural areas.

Litteral quotes are removed on an assumption that it is highly likely they contain snippets of text in other languages, or spoken text which might have other properties than written text.

Whatever don't pass the spellchecker is removed too, on the assumption that the term seems so strange that it is unlikely they are a good source for language detection. This step is rather dangerous, as it can easilly remove what is indicative for a specific language variant.

The *prior probability of the language variant* is given in the marginals section of the statistics, while the prior probability of the predictor must be calculated over all actual variants. If the purpose is only to compare the posterior probability, ie. identification of the language variant, then the prior probability of the predictor can be dropped.

### N-grams

These statistics describe the differences in use of N-grams, that is the *conditinal probability for observing the N-gram given the language specific form*.

These statistics are completely built by the script, with N-grams extracted from the text sources.

### Affixes

These statistics describe the differences in use of affixes, that is the *conditinal probability for observing the affix given the language specific form*.

These statistics are built with the affix files as patterns, with terms extracted from the text sources.

### Keywords

These statistics describe the differences in use of keywords, that is the *conditinal probability for observing the keywords given the language specific form*.

These statistics are bult with the affix files and keywords as patterns, with terms extracted from the text sources.
